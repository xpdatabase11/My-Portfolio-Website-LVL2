        <h2> UNIT 15 Installing and Maintaining Software </h2>
        <p>
        This Unit was all about Software, it explained what is going on behind the scenes when software is run. It gone into some deph it explained how the software communicates with hardware, what is binary, what is programming languages, how you can fix or maintain an operating system, how install new operating systems, etc. This Unit also explained different types of roles that you have as an IT enthusiast in the IT industry, such as IT technician, Technical support engineer, etc.
        <p>
        With this Unit i had no issues as i already knew quite a lot about software, but i did learn quite a lot as well there were many things which i didn't know. One of the things which i didn't really know in deph was binary i knew what it was but i didn't know how it works or how you can calculate it.
