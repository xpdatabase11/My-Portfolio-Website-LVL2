        <h2> UNIT 13 Website Development </h2>
        <p>
        This Unit focuses on the development of a website, its meant to teach you how to create your own assets for websites, implementing interactive features, using software such as Dreamweaver, etc. Being able to build websites can be an inportant skill, it could be used for making portfolios, making your own game,  making a family website where you store your photos, etc. But most importantly there are a lot of jobs offered to people who can build websites as a lot of people want to have their own website, but those people mainly lack the skill and don't have the time or rather they are lazy to learn how to do it them selfs.
        </p>
        <p>
        What i have done for this assignment is instead of using dream weaver or wix and use lots of templates, i challanged my self to learn HTML and CSS and bit of Javascript. It wasn't that hard actually and it was in my opinion way more fun and rewarding to learn to do it the hardway, doing it this way allowed me some flexibility and also let me implement what ever feature i wanted. This impacted the performance of the website as the code was clean and didn't include all the unnessesary things, so the website run silky smooth and without any issues.
