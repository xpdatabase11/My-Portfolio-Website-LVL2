        <h2> UNIT 14 Installing and Maintaining Hardware </h2>
        <p>
        This Unit consisted of learning and about how to install and maintain hardware, it covered all the topics ranging from cleaning techniques, describing the components of a computer, what does those components do and how do they work, safety and hazard, different tools to be used for repairs, etc. This unit was one of the only ones to include a practical task, we have gathered broken machines that needed to be repaired, we were gathered into groups of 3 to fix those machines. It was pretty fun, it was at least something different then just writing it was a refreshing experience being able to do something practical in a while.
